# Game chat bot

This chat bot is mainly designed for playing RPG's with Discord. Originally this was based on Micheal Mulders "How to build Your First Discord Bot with Node.js" (https://www.sitepoint.com/discord-bot-node-js/).

I planned this chatbot to have connection to Google Docs (for character management), router for taking in different commands, rolling dices and ability to tell rules of 
chosen game system (again stored in Google Docs).

## Requirements

- [Google Docs] (https://docs.google.com) Goodle Docs account
